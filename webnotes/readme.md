# Alfred Workflow
Download the workflow here (Add Link)

# Usage
- install [alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- download and install [workflow](www.google.com)
- install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)
- adjust the 3 global variables in the script to your liking:
  - Necessary for running
    - PATH: the path to your notes-folder (has to exist)
  - Optional
      - FILE_EXTENSION: use .md to work with obsidian
      - DELIMITER: which character to use in the index file to delimit links and filenames (a kanji is a good start, we want a character that never occurs in weblinks or filenames to avoid parsing conflicts)
